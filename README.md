# Test Automation Project README

## Overview

   Welcome to the NETFYDE_TEST_SUITE! This project aims to automate testing processes for netryde ride-sharing.

## Purpose

    The primary purpose of this project is to:

        1 Increase testing efficiency by automating repetitive test cases.
        2 Ensure the reliability and stability of the application by executing automated tests.


## Features
        1, Automated Testing: Execute predefined test cases automatically.
        2, Customizable Test Suites: Create and configure test suites based on specific requirements.
        3, Cross-Browser Testing: Run tests across multiple web browsers to ensure compatibility.
        4, Headless Testing: Perform tests in headless mode for faster execution.
        5, Parallel Execution: Execute tests in parallel to reduce overall test execution time.
        6, Reporting: Generate detailed test reports for analysis and debugging.
